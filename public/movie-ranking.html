<h1>The Best Movies According to Sabita</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Nomadland</h3>
<p>This is a human interaction movie which shows us believable people, meeting and gaining sparks from one another.</p>
<h3>Father</h3>
<p>Great movie about family, love, anger, and forgiveness.</p>
<h3>Lost in Translation</h3>
<p>The movie brilliantly depicts how two very different people can become close in an instant, as long as there's a common bond.</p>
